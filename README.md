# Notes about contents...
My Repo is jewrepo, the lanik repos are another dev that makes a great cleaning addon, that cleaning addon is Kcleaner and the version i have here is my own custom quick fix version of it to make it work proper on Kodi 20 with no debug log issues. (I Also made changes to the lanik python 3 repo addon.xml file in order to fix the annoying debug stuff it causes due to its http use when it should be https. but it doesnt seem to matter lmao. just gotta wait for that dev to update things.) The youtube plugin here is a modified version from someone else that seems to fix stuff that the legit version has broken still. The A4kSubtitles repo has been tossed in as well for lazy install reasons :).
